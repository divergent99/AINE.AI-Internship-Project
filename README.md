Project 6: Data Manipulation and Visualization using Python
Project : Creating visuals and charts using Python libraries
About the project: The project contains three parts:
Data manipulation using Pandas (Hands-on training)
Data visualization using Matplotlib (HandS-on training)
Data manipulation and analysis on Python (Guided Assessment)
Difficulty Level: Intermediate
Tools to Use: Google Colaboratory
Aim: Performing data manipulation and visualization techniques using Python to clean, transform and visualize different datasets.
Objectives:
